# 🚀 AI-Experts Go-to-Market Strategy (Israel 2026)

## 1. Leverage "Programmatic SEO" (Technical Marketing)
Our biggest asset is the dynamic structure we just built. Every task and every expert gets a unique, indexable URL.
*   **Action**: Ensure `sitemap.xml` is submitted to Google Search Console immediately.
*   **Strategy**: "Long-tail Domination". Instead of competing on "AI", we compete on specific intents:
    *   "סדנת Midjourney למשרדי פרסום"
    *   "ייעוץ AI למנהלי מוצר"
    *   "הרצאת ChatGPT לארגונים"
*   **Execution**: encourages clients to write detailed descriptions, as these become the rich content Google loves.

## 2. The "Supply-Side" Flywheel (Experts First)
We need a critical mass of experts to attract clients.
*   **Value Prop**: "Stop chasing leads. Let the leads come to you."
*   **Tactic**: Reach out to top Israeli AI influencers (LinkedIn is key in IL).
*   **Offer**: "Founding Member" status (Top placement on homepage) for the first 50 verified experts.
*   **Viral Loop**: When an expert joins, give them a shiny "Verified Expert on AI-Experts.co.il" badge/image to share on LinkedIn. This drives traffic back to their profile.

## 3. LinkedIn Automation (The "GeoAudit" Playbook)
Since we already have experience with LinkedIn automation (from your previous work), we can adapt it here.
*   **Bot**: Scanning for posts looking for "AI lecturers", "Workshops", or "AI consultants".
*   **Action**: Auto-reply or DM suggesting to post the requirement on AI-Experts to get competitive bids.
*   **Content**: regularly share "Task of the Week" on the official company page.
    *   *Example*: "New Lead! Tech company in Tel Aviv looking for LLM fine-tuning expert. Budget: 15k NIS. Bid here: [Link]"

## 4. "Fake it 'til you make it" (Seeding the Marketplace)
Empty marketplaces die. We need activity.
*   **Seeding**: Manually curate real requests found in FB groups ("AI Masters", "ChatGPT Israel") and repost them (with permission or as "Concierge") to the platform.
*   **Concierge MVP**: If a client posts, *you* manually find the expert for them initially to ensure the first few matches are 5-star experiences.

## 5. B2B Partnerships
*   **Target**: HR Managers & L&D (Learning & Development) in large corps.
*   **Pitch**: "You have an annual training budget? We have a menu of 20+ vetted AI workshops ready to book."
*   **Asset**: Create a PDF "Catalog of Workshops 2026" generated from the DB offerings.
